# MenuWADloader
A small browser extension that lets you download Wii Menu WAD files in 3 clicks!
It fetches from MarioCube's repositories, creates a WAD, then downloads it within seconds!

Just choose your version (1.0E not supported yet) and hit download!

**DISCLAIMER:**
Installing system menu WADs on actual Wiis (including vWiis) can BRICK them!
It's safer to install them on Dolphin Emulator, which usually isn't brickable by installing them.
I'm not responsible for ANY damages that occur to such hardware.
Be warned!
